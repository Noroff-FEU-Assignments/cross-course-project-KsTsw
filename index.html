    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
        attacks?</p>
    <p id="web security-answer">Here are my recommendations on how to secure and protect your website: <br>
        You should activate a firewall, which will be responsible for monotoring incoming/outgoing traffic. <br>
        You should create strong passwords. Using diffrent passwords for diffrent accounts and change them on a regular
        basis.
        Ideally you should make your passwords complicated using numbers/letters/special characters. <br>
        Make backups of your data regularly and store them on diffrent locations to recover from a security incident.
        <br>
        Installing an SSL Certificate that will secure exchanged data between your website and any visitor. <br>
        Install security tools and regularly scan to detect issues before they cause too much damage. <br>
        Restrict or control what data visitors can upload to your website.
